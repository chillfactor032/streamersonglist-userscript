# StreamerSongList Userscript

Userscript for StreamerSongList that contains convenience features. If you want to see what the script is doing, it prints its actions to the Javascript Console. Feel free to open an issue against this repo if you have a problem or want to suggest a feature.

# Install Instructions (TamperMonkey)

Open the TamperMonkey Dashboard and click Utilities. From here go down to "Import from URL" and paste the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chillfactor032/streamersonglist-userscript/main/ssl_userscript.js` in the box and click Install. There will be a confirmation page where you will need to click Install one more time. You can auto-update this script by checking the box next to it in the dashboard and selecting "Trigger Update", then Start.

# Queue Page Features

On the queue page, this script will add 2 buttons per row. It will add an edit button and a move to top button. These buttons can be used to quickly manipulate the row without having to check the box, the scroll to the top to press the buttons. 

# Song Page Features

No changes have been made to the Song page. 

# Known Issues

The edit button added to the queue rows will only work if the checkbox is unchecked. This is because the act of clicking the button checks the box. I may eventually fix this if it becomes a problem.
